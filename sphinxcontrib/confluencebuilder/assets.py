    a confluence assets tracker

    The asset manager is used to track detect assets to be referenced to and
    published (if configured) to a Confluence instance. The manager has the
    ability to track locations of assets, detect duplicate uses of assets (when
    references and/or duplicate physical files) and more. Typically, the builder
    will scan the list of documents to be processed for assets. When the
    translator is running, it will refer to the asset manager to know where an
    asset will be published (so the translator knows how to reference the
    asset). Finally, during the publishing phase, the list of tracked assets can
    be published to the respective publish points.
