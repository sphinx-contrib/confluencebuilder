.. note::

    As of v3, only the Confluence v2 editor is published. Atlassian has given
    notice about the `deprecation of their older editor`_. Since validation is
    published on Confluence Cloud, there is no publish endpoint that
    demonstrates Confluence Data Center's v1 editor support.

Validation content is published for a given release tag. This is used to help
verify support of various Sphinx-provided capabilities, as well as show
possible limitations.

This content has been generated with
`sphinxcontrib-confluencebuilder`_ |test_desc|.
