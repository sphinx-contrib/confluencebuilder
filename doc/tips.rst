confluence spaces and unique page names
---------------------------------------

An important consideration when using this extension is that Confluence has a
requirement to having unique page names for a given space. When this extension
parses a document's title value, the title is used as either a creation point or
an update point (i.e. if the page name does not exist, it will be created; if
the page name does exist, it will be updated).

One must be cautious when mixing a space with manually prepared content and
published content from this extension. Consider the following use case.

A space MyAwesomeSpace already exists with the following content:

* MyHome
* About
* Tutorials
* See Also

A user may desire to publish a series of Sphinx documentation into a "container"
by, so the page "Documentation" is made:

- MyHome
- About
- **Documentation**
- Tutorials
- See Also

If the Sphinx documentation contains a page named "About", unexpected events
may occur to new users after publishing for the first time. One might expect the
following to be published:

- MyHome
- About
- Documentation

  - About (new)
  - Installing (new)
  - User Guide (new)
  - Other (new)

- Tutorials
- See Also

However, since Confluence only supports a single "About" page for a space, the
original "About" page is updated with new content from the documentation set and
is moved as a child of the container page:

- MyHome
- Documentation

  - About (**updated and moved**)
  - Installing (new)
  - User Guide (new)
  - Other (new)

- Tutorials
- See Also

Users needing to restrict the extension from possibly mangling manually prepared
content can use the ``confluence_publish_prefix``
(:ref:`jump<confluence_publish_prefix>`) or ``confluence_publish_postfix``
(:ref:`jump<confluence_publish_postfix>`) options.

setting a publishing timeout
----------------------------

By default, this extension does not define any timeouts for a publish event. It
is recommended to provide a timeout value based on the environment being used
(see ``confluence_timeout``; :ref:`jump<confluence_timeout>`).

.. _tip_manage_publish_subset:

manage publishing a document subset
-----------------------------------

Users have the ability to publish a subset of processed documents by using the
``confluence_publish_subset`` (:ref:`jump<confluence_publish_subset>`) option.
This can be useful for large documentation sets where a user may wish to only
publish an update for one or more documents (instead of the entire set). While
subset publishing can be commonly used by setting the
``confluence_publish_subset`` option in a command line build, this may not be
ideal for some environments. The following is a code snippet, which when
included in a project's ``conf.py`` file, will provide a means for a user to
specify a file outlining which documents are desired:

.. code-block:: python

    subset_path = os.getenv('PUBLISH_SUBSET')
    if subset_path and os.path.isfile(subset_path):
        with open(subset_path) as f:
            confluence_publish_subset = [line
                                         for raw_line in f
                                         for line in [raw_line.strip()]
                                         if line and not line.startswith('#')]

Individual documents can be added into the file defined by the environment
variable ``PUBLISH_SUBSET`` per line. In this snippet, blank lines and lines
commented out with the ``#`` character are ignored.
