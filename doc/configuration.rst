Configuration
=============

The following is an example of simple configuration (``conf.py``) for
Confluence generation and publishing:

.. code-block:: python

    extensions = [
        'sphinxcontrib.confluencebuilder',
    ]
    confluence_publish = True
    confluence_space_key = 'TEST'
    confluence_parent_page = 'Documentation'
    confluence_server_url = 'https://intranet-wiki.example.com/'
    confluence_server_user = 'myawesomeuser'
    confluence_ask_password = True

All configurations introduced by this extension are listed below. This
extension may take advantage of a subset of `Sphinx configurations`_ as well
when preparing documents.

.. versionadded:: 1.9

    All options provided by this extension may be set from the running
    environment. For example, if :lref:`confluence_publish` is not explicitly
    set inside ``conf.py`` or provided via `Sphinx's command line`_, this
    extension may check the ``CONFLUENCE_PUBLISH`` environment option as a
    fallback. Note that this only applies options provided below and will
    not work for other configuration options provided by Sphinx or other
    Sphinx extensions.

.. only:: latex

    .. contents::
       :depth: 1
       :local:

Essential configuration
-----------------------

.. (documentation note) Typically, configuration entries should be sorted
   alphanumerically; however, an exception is in place for the "essential"
   configuration options, where there is a stronger desire to present key
   configurations in a specific order (publish, URL, space and authentication).

.. _confluence_publish:

.. confval:: confluence_publish

    A boolean that decides whether or not to allow publishing. This option must
    be explicitly set to ``True`` if a user wishes to publish content. By
    default, the value is set to ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish = True

    Re-publishing supports checking for page changes. Pages that have not
    changed will not be updated (see :lref:`confluence_publish_force`).

.. _confluence_server_url:

.. confval:: confluence_server_url

    The URL for the Confluence instance to publish to. The URL should be
    prefixed with ``https://`` or ``http://`` (depending on the URL target). The
    target API folder should not be included in the URL (i.e. excluding
    ``rest/api/``). For a Confluence Cloud instance, an example URL
    configuration is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_server_url = 'https://example.atlassian.net/wiki/'

    For Confluence Data Center, an example URL configuration, if the
    instance's REST API is ``https://intranet-wiki.example.com/rest/api/``,
    should be as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_server_url = 'https://intranet-wiki.example.com/'

.. _confluence_space_key:

.. confval:: confluence_space_key

    .. note::

        - Use the key value for the space, not the name of the space. For
          example, ``MYAWESOMESPACE`` instead of ``My Awesome Space``.
        - The space key is **case-sensitive** (typically uppercase).

    `Key of the space`_ in Confluence to be used to publish generated documents
    to. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_space_key = 'MYAWESOMESPACE'

    If attempting to publish to a user's personal space, the space's key will
    typically start with a tilde value followed by the space's identifier. For
    example:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_space_key = '~123456789'

    .. versionadded:: 1.7

.. raw:: latex

    \newpage

.. _confluence_server_user:

.. confval:: confluence_server_user

    .. note::

        If using a personal access token (PAT), this option does not need to
        set (see :lref:`confluence_publish_token`).

    .. note::

        If trying to use netrc authentication, support is provided by the
        Requests_ library [#netrc]_. A user can default to using a configured
        netrc file by not setting a value for ``confluence_server_user``.

    The username value used to authenticate with the Confluence instance. If
    using Confluence Cloud, this value will most likely be the account's E-mail
    address. If using Confluence Data Center, this value will most likely be the
    username value.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_server_user = 'myawesomeuser@example.com'
         (or)
        confluence_server_user = 'myawesomeuser'

.. raw:: latex

    \newpage

.. _confluence_api_token:

.. confval:: confluence_api_token

    .. tip::

        Use this option for Confluence Cloud.

    .. note::

        If using a scoped API token, users are required to also enable
        :lref:`confluence_api_token_scoped` option or ensure their
        :lref:`confluence_server_url` configuration points to a modern
        Confluence API endpoint ("api.atlassian.com") for their site.

        View :ref:`required scope permission <publish_permissions>`.

    .. caution::

        It is never recommended to store an API token into a committed/shared
        repository holding documentation.

        A documentation's configuration can modified various ways with Python
        to pull an authentication token for a publishing event such as
        :ref:`reading from an environment variable <tip_manage_publish_subset>`,
        reading from a local file or acquiring a token from ``getpass``.

    .. note::

        If attempting to use a personal access token (PAT), use the
        :lref:`confluence_publish_token` option instead.

    The API token value used to authenticate with the Confluence instance. Set
    this option to an API token for the configured username value
    (see `API tokens`_):

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_api_token = 'YDYDD3qVvKV0FbkErSxaQ2olmy...AMGwaPe8=02381T9A'

    .. versionadded:: 2.6

.. raw:: latex

    \newpage

.. _confluence_api_token_scoped:

.. confval:: confluence_api_token_scoped

    .. tip::

        Use this option for Confluence Cloud when using an API scoped token.

    Enable this option to automatically convert a Confluence Cloud Wiki URL
    to a Confluence Cloud API endpoint URL. When using an API scoped token,
    Confluence expects an alternative API endpoint for calls. For example,

    .. code-block:: none

        https://example.atlassian.net/wiki/

    The following is needed:

    .. code-block:: none

        https://api.atlassian.com/ex/confluence/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/

    The GUID for a space can be determined by venturing to:

    .. code-block:: none

        https://example.atlassian.net/_edge/tenant_info

    Users may opt to configuring :lref:`confluence_server_url` to the newer
    API endpoint for scoped tokens. However, enabling this option can perform
    the translation for users who prefer to configure the Wiki endpoint. By
    default, this option is not enabled with a value of ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_api_token_scoped = True

    .. versionadded:: 2.7

.. raw:: latex

    \newpage

.. _confluence_publish_token:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_token

    .. tip::

        Use this option for Confluence Data Center.

    .. caution::

        It is never recommended to store a personal access tokens (PAT) into a
        committed/shared repository holding documentation.

        A documentation's configuration can modified various ways with Python
        to pull an authentication token for a publishing event such as
        :ref:`reading from an environment variable <tip_manage_publish_subset>`,
        reading from a local file or acquiring a token from ``getpass``.

    .. note::

        If attempting to use an API token, use the
        :lref:`confluence_server_pass` option instead.

    The personal access token value used to authenticate with the Confluence
    instance (see `Using Personal Access Tokens`_):

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_token = 'AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxY/z1234567890aBc'

    .. versionadded:: 1.8

.. raw:: latex

    \newpage

.. _confluence_server_pass:

.. confval:: confluence_server_pass

    .. warning::

        It is not recommended to use this option when authenticating with
        an API token or a personal access token.

    .. note::

        Functionally, this option is the same as :lref:`confluence_api_token`.
        It is recommended to use the API token variant solely for naming
        convention. Only limited cases can use a password value for
        publication over API tokens or personal access tokens (specifically,
        cases using Confluence Data Center). Unless users are expected to
        interact directly with their Confluence instance with user passwords,
        users should instead use either one of the following options instead:

        - :lref:`confluence_api_token`
        - :lref:`confluence_publish_token`

    .. caution::

        It is never recommended to store a raw password into a
        committed/shared repository holding documentation. If desired, this
        extension provides a method for prompting for a password
        (see :lref:`confluence_ask_password`).

        Future versions *may* deprecate this option.

    The password value used to authenticate with the Confluence instance. This
    value expects the plaintext password for the configured username value:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_server_pass = 'myawesomepassword'

Generic configuration
---------------------

.. _confluence_add_secnumbers:

.. confval:: confluence_add_secnumbers

    Add section numbers to page and section titles if ``toctree`` uses the
    ``:numbered:`` option. By default, this is enabled:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_add_secnumbers = True

    See also :lref:`confluence_publish_prefix`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.2

.. _confluence_code_block_theme:

.. confval:: confluence_code_block_theme

    .. note::

        This option is only supported using the ``v1``
        :ref:`editor <confluence_editor>`.

    Specifies the color scheme to use when displaying a Confluence code
    block macro.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_code_block_theme = 'Midnight'

    For configuring the theme on individual code blocks, see
    :ref:`class hints <confluence_class_hints>`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.2

.. confval:: confluence_default_alignment

    Explicitly set which alignment type to use when a default alignment value is
    detected. As of Sphinx 2.0+, the default alignment is set to ``center``.
    Legacy versions of Sphinx had a default alignment of ``left``. By default,
    this extension will use a Sphinx-defined default alignment unless explicitly
    set by this configuration value. Accepted values are ``left``, ``center`` or
    ``right``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_default_alignment = 'left'

    .. versionadded:: 1.3

.. confval:: confluence_default_table_width

    Width for a table (v2 editor).
    It has been observed that when attempting to fix specific column widths on
    a table in the v2 editor, Confluence applies a default data width of 760 on
    the table. By default, this value is 760.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_default_table_width = 2000

.. confval:: confluence_disable_env_conf

    A boolean value to configure whether to ignore environment-provided
    configuration options. This extension will fallback on environment
    variables if an option is not set in a configuration file or on the
    command line. If a user never wants to pull options from the environment,
    this option can be set to ``True``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_disable_env_conf = True

    .. versionadded:: 2.7

.. confval:: confluence_domain_indices

    A boolean or list value to configure whether or not generate domain-specific
    indices. If configured to a value of ``True``, all domain-specific indices
    generated when processing a documentation set will have a Confluence
    document created. If configured with a list of index names, any matching
    domain-index with a matching name will have a Confluence document created.
    By default, domain-specific indices are disabled with a value of ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_domain_indices = True
         (or)
        confluence_domain_indices = [
            'py-modindex',
        ]

    .. versionadded:: 1.7

.. _confluence_editor:

.. confval:: confluence_editor

    .. important::

        - This option should not be used for Confluence Data Center.

        - This option is to hint at what editor style to use on Confluence
          Cloud. As of year 2025, the default editor used is ``v1``. However,
          this will change in 2026 as Atlassian
          `deprecates their older editor`_.

        - If a page is published with a ``v2`` editor, an attempt to re-publish
          with a ``v1`` editor style may be ignored in Confluence Cloud. In
          such situations, users are recommended to delete the pages on
          Confluence and then retry the publish attempt with this extension.

    A string value to indicate which `Confluence editor`_ to target. The
    following editor values are supported:

    - ``v1``: Use Confluence's older editor (default).
    - ``v2``: Use Confluence's newer editor (fabric).

    A user can choose which version of the editor to build and published
    documentation with. This extension may adjust how content is generated
    based on which editor is selected.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_editor = 'v1'

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

.. _confluence_header_file:

.. confval:: confluence_header_file

    The name of the file to use header data. If provided, the raw contents found
    inside the header file will be added to the start of all generated
    documents. The file path provided should be relative to the build
    environment's source directory. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_header_file = 'assets/header.tpl'

    See also:

    - :lref:`confluence_footer_file`
    - :lref:`confluence_header_data`

.. _confluence_header_data:

.. confval:: confluence_header_data

    Takes an optional dictionary. If this value is set then
    ``confluence_header_file`` is interpreted as a jinja2 template with these
    values passed in. If this value is not set then ``confluence_header_file``
    is included verbatim.

    See also :lref:`confluence_header_file`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9

.. _confluence_footer_file:

.. confval:: confluence_footer_file

    The name of the file to use footer data. If provided, the raw contents found
    inside the footer file will be added at the end of all generated documents.
    The file path provided should be relative to the build environment's source
    directory. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_footer_file = 'assets/footer.tpl'

    See also:

    - :lref:`confluence_header_file`
    - :lref:`confluence_footer_data`

.. _confluence_footer_data:

.. confval:: confluence_footer_data

    Takes an optional dictionary. If this value is set then
    ``confluence_footer_file`` is interpreted as a jinja2 template with these
    values passed in. If this value is not set then ``confluence_footer_file``
    is included verbatim.

    See also :lref:`confluence_header_file`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9

.. confval:: confluence_include_search

    A boolean value to configure whether or not generate a search page. If
    configured to a value of ``True``, a search page will be created with a
    search macro configured to search on the configured space. If a ``search``
    document is registered in a documentation's toctree_, a search page will be
    generated and will replace the contents of the provided ``search`` page. To
    avoid the implicit enablement of this feature, the generation of a search
    page can be explicitly disabled by setting this value to ``False``. By
    default, search page generation is automatically managed with a value of
    ``None``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_include_search = True

    .. versionadded:: 1.7

.. confval:: confluence_page_generation_notice

    This option can be set with a boolean value to whether or not to generate
    a message at the top of each document that the page has been
    automatically generated.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_page_generation_notice = True

    Alternatively, users may set a custom message to display.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_page_generation_notice = 'My awesome message.'

    By default, this notice is disabled with a value of ``False``.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7
    .. versionchanged:: 2.5 Accept a string for custom notice.

.. confval:: confluence_page_hierarchy

    A boolean value to whether or not nest pages in a hierarchical ordered. The
    root of all pages is typically the configured root_doc_. If a root_doc_
    instance contains a toctree_, listed documents will become child pages of
    the root_doc_. This cycle continues for child pages with their own
    toctree_ markups. By default, hierarchy mode is enabled with a value of
    ``True``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_page_hierarchy = True

    Note that even if hierarchy mode is enabled, the configured root_doc_ page
    and other published pages that are not defined in the complete toctree_,
    these documents will still be published and uploaded to either the
    configured :lref:`confluence_parent_page` or in the root of the space.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0 Option is enabled by default.

.. _confluence_prev_next_buttons_location:

.. confval:: confluence_prev_next_buttons_location

    A string value to where to include previous/next buttons (if any) based on
    the detected order of documents to be included in processing. Values
    accepted are either ``bottom``, ``both``, ``top`` or ``None``. By default,
    no previous/next links are generated with a value of ``None``.

    .. code-block:: python

       confluence_prev_next_buttons_location = 'top'

    .. versionadded:: 1.2

.. _confluence_secnumber_suffix:

.. confval:: confluence_secnumber_suffix

    The suffix to put after section numbers, before section name.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_secnumber_suffix = '. '

    See also :lref:`confluence_add_secnumbers`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.2

.. confval:: confluence_sourcelink

    Provides options to include a link to the documentation's sources at the top
    of each page. This can either be a generic URL or customized to link to
    individual documents in a repository.

    An example of a simple link is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_sourcelink = {
            'url': 'https//www.example.com/',
        }

    Templates for popular hosting services are available. Instead of defining
    a ``url`` option, the ``type`` option can instead be set to one of the
    following types:

    - ``bitbucket``
    - ``codeberg``
    - ``github``
    - ``gitlab``

    Options to set for these types are as follows:

    .. rst-class:: spacedtable

    +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | Option          | Description                                           |
    +=================+=======================================================+
    | | ``owner``     | The owner (group or user) of a project.               |
    | | *(required)*  |                                                       |
    +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | | ``repo``      | The name of the repository.                           |
    | | *(required)*  |                                                       |
    +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``container``   | The folder inside the repository which is holding the |
    |                 | documentation. This will vary per project, for        |
    |                 | example, this may be ``Documentation/`` or ``doc/``.  |
    |                 | If the documentation resides in the root of the       |
    |                 | repository, this option can be omitted or set to an   |
    |                 | empty string.                                         |
    +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | | ``version``   | The version of the sources to list. This is typically |
    | | *(required)*  | set to either a branch (e.g. ``main``) or tag value.  |
    |                 |                                                       |
    |                 | For Codeberg, also include the version type. For      |
    |                 | example, ``branch/main`` or ``tag/1.0``.              |
    +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``view``        | The view mode to configure. By default, this value is |
    |                 | set to ``blob`` for GitHub/GitLab and ``view`` for    |
    |                 | Bitbucket.                                            |
    |                 |                                                       |
    |                 | GitHub/GitLab users may wish to change this to        |
    |                 | ``edit`` to create a link directly to the editing     |
    |                 | view for a specific document.                         |
    +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``host``        | The hostname value to override.                       |
    |                 |                                                       |
    |                 | This option is useful for instances where a custom    |
    |                 | domain may be configured for an organization.         |
    +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``protocol``    | The protocol value to override (defaults to           |
    |                 | ``https``).                                           |
    +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

    For example, a project hosted on GitHub can use the following:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_sourcelink = {
            'type': 'github',
            'owner': 'sphinx-contrib',
            'repo': 'confluencebuilder',
            'container': 'doc/',
            'version': 'main',
            'view': 'edit',
        }

    For unique environments, the source URL can be customized through the
    ``url`` option. This option is treated as a format string which can be
    populated based on the configuration and individual documents being
    processed. An example is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_sourcelink = {
            'url': 'https://git.example.com/mydocs/{page}{suffix}',
        }

    This configures a base URL, where ``page`` and ``suffix`` will be generated
    automatically. Any option provided in the ``confluence_sourcelink``
    dictionary will be forwarded to the format option. For example:

.. confval:: confluence_use_index

    A boolean value to configure whether or not generate an index page. If
    configured to a value of ``True``, an index page will be created. If a
    ``genindex`` document is registered in a documentation's toctree_, index
    content will be generated and will replace the contents of the provided
    ``genindex`` page. To avoid the implicit enablement of this feature, the
    generation of an index page can be explicitly disabled by setting this value
    to ``False``. By default, index generation is automatically managed with a
    value of ``None``.

Publishing configuration
------------------------

.. _confluence_append_labels:

.. confval:: confluence_append_labels

    Allows a user to decide how to manage labels for an updated page. When a
    page update contains new labels to set, they can either be stacked on
    existing labels or replaced. In the event that a publisher wishes to replace
    any existing labels that are set on published pages, this option can be set
    to ``False``. By default, labels are always appended with a value of
    ``True``.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3

.. _confluence_api_mode:

.. confval:: confluence_api_mode

    Configures the API mode to use for REST requests. Certain Confluence
    instances support a newer version of REST APIs (e.g. Confluence Cloud).
    This extension will attempt to use an appropriate API mode for a
    configuration set. However, a user can override the operating API mode
    based on preference or when handling situations where this extension
    cannot automatically determine the best API mode to use. Values
    accepted are either ``v1`` or ``v2``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_api_mode = 'v2'

    By default, if a Confluence Cloud configuration is detected, this
    extension will use ``v2``. For all other cases, the default is ``v1``.

    .. versionadded:: 2.5

.. _confluence_ask_password:

.. confval:: confluence_ask_password

    .. warning::

        User's running Cygwin/MinGW may need to invoke with ``winpty`` to allow
        this feature to work.

    Provides an override for an interactive shell to request publishing
    documents using an API key or password provided from a shell environment.
    While a password is typically defined in the option
    :lref:`confluence_server_pass` (either directly set, fetched from the
    project's ``config.py`` or passed via an alternative means), select
    environments may wish to provide a way to accept an authentication
    token without needing to modify documentation sources or having a
    visible password value in the interactive session requesting the
    publish event. By default, this option is disabled with a value
    of ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_ask_password = False

    A user can request for a password prompt by invoking build event by passing
    the define through the command line:

    .. code-block:: none

        sphinx-build [options] -D confluence_ask_password=1 <srcdir> <outdir>

    Note that some shell sessions may not be able to pull the password value
    properly from the user. For example, Cygwin/MinGW may not be able to accept
    a password unless invoked with ``winpty``.

.. confval:: confluence_ask_user

    Provides an override for an interactive shell to request publishing
    documents using a user provided from a shell environment. While a
    user is typically defined in the option ``confluence_server_user``, select
    environments may wish to provide a way to accept a username without needing
    to modify documentation sources. By default, this option is disabled with a
    value of ``False``.

    .. warning::

        Only Confluence Cloud identifies support for an archiving API.
        Attempting to Confluence Data Center with this feature will most
        likely result in an "Unsupported Confluence API call" error (500).

    .. attention::

        Confluence's archiving API is marked as experimental by Atlassian
        at the time of writing. This feature may experience issues over time
        until the API is flagged as stable (if ever).

    A boolean value to whether to archive legacy pages detected in a space or
    parent page. By default, this value is set to ``False`` to indicate that no
    pages will be archived. If this configuration is set to ``True``, detected
    pages in Confluence that do not match the set of published documents will be
    automatically archived. If the option :lref:`confluence_parent_page` is
    set, only pages which are a descendant of the configured parent page
    can be removed; otherwise, all flagged pages in the configured space
    could be archived.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_cleanup_archive = False

    While this capability is useful for updating a series of pages, it may lead
    to unexpected results when attempting to publish a single-page update. The
    archive operation will archive all pages that are not publish in the
    request. For example, if an original request publishes ten documents and
    archives excess documents, a following publish attempt with only one of
    the documents will archive the other nine pages.

.. _confluence_cleanup_from_root:

.. confval:: confluence_cleanup_from_root

    A boolean value to which indicates that any cleanup attempt should be done
    from the root of a published root_doc_ page (instead of a configured parent
    page; i.e. :lref:`confluence_parent_page`). In specific publishing
    scenarios, a user may wish to publish multiple documentation sets
    based off a single parent/container page. To prevent any cleanup
    between multiple documentation sets, this option can be set to ``True``.
    When generating legacy pages to be removed, this extension will only
    attempt to populate legacy pages based off the children of the
    root_doc_ page. This option requires either
    :lref:`confluence_cleanup_archive` or :lref:`confluence_cleanup_purge`
    to be set to ``True`` before taking effect. If
    :lref:`confluence_publish_root` is set, this option is implicitly enabled.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_disable_notifications = True

    Note that even if this option is set, there may be some scenarios where a

    A boolean value to whether to publish pages using the full width of a page.
    By default, page widths will use their default/existing page widths with
    a value of ``None``. Specifying this option to ``True`` will ensure any
    new/updated page will attempt to use the full width of a page; likewise,
    specifying this option to ``False`` will ensure any new/updated page will
    attempt to use a smaller width.

    .. code-block:: python

.. _confluence_parent_page:

.. confval:: confluence_parent_page

    .. note::

        This option cannot be used with :lref:`confluence_publish_root`.

    The root page found inside the configured space
    (:lref:`confluence_space_key`) where published pages will be a
    descendant of. The parent page value is used to match either the
    title or page identifier of an existing page. If this option is not
    provided, new pages will be published to the root of the configured
    space. If the parent page cannot be found, the publish attempt will
    stop with an error message. For example, the following will publish
    documentation under the ``MyAwesomeDocs`` page:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_parent_page = 'MyAwesomeDocs'

    Users wishing to publish against a parent page's identifier value can do
    so by using an integer value instead. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_parent_page = 123456

    If a parent page is not set, consider using the
    :lref:`confluence_root_homepage` option as well. Note that the
    page's name can be case-sensitive in most (if not all) versions of
    Confluence.

    See also :lref:`confluence_publish_root`.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.9 Support added for accepting a page identifier.

.. _confluence_publish_dryrun:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_dryrun

    When a user wishes to start managing a new document set for publishing,
    there maybe concerns about conflicts with existing content. When the dry run
    feature is enabled to ``True``, a publish event will not edit or remove any
    existing content. Instead, the extension will inform the user which pages
    will be created, whether or not pages will be moved and whether or not
    pages/attachments will be removed. By default, the dry run feature is
    disabled with a value of ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

    :ref:`Confluence Spaces and Unique Page Names <confluence_unique_page_names>`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3

.. _confluence_publish_postfix:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_postfix

    If set, a postfix value is added to the title of all published documents. In
    Confluence, page names need to be unique for a space. A postfix can be set
    to either:

    * Add a unique naming schema to generated/published documents in a space
      which has manually created pages; or,
    * Allow multiple published sets of documentation, each with their own
      postfix value.

    An example publish postfix is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

       confluence_publish_postfix = '-postfix'

    Postfixes can include placeholders. These placeholders are filled using the
    format method so formatting types can be used. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

       confluence_publish_postfix = ' ({hash:.5})'

    Supported placeholders:

    * ``{hash}`` - Create a reproducible hash given the title and location
      based from the project root. Using this placeholder provides an option
      for allowing pages with the same title to be pushed to the same
      Confluence space without needing to manually add an index to the title.

    By default, no postfix is used. See also:

    - :lref:`confluence_ignore_titlefix_on_index`
    - :lref:`confluence_publish_prefix`

    .. versionadded:: 1.2
    .. versionchanged:: 1.9 Support for the ``{hash}`` placeholder.

.. _confluence_publish_prefix:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_prefix

    If set, a prefix value is added to the title of all published documents. In
    Confluence, page names need to be unique for a space. A prefix can be set to
    either:

    * Add a unique naming schema to generated/published documents in a space
      which has manually created pages; or,
    * Allow multiple published sets of documentation, each with their own prefix
      value.

    An example publish prefix is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

       confluence_publish_prefix = 'prefix-'

    By default, no prefix is used. See also:

    - :lref:`confluence_ignore_titlefix_on_index`
    - :lref:`confluence_publish_postfix`

.. _confluence_publish_root:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_root

    .. note::

        This option cannot be used with :lref:`confluence_parent_page`.

    The page identifier to publish the root document to. The root identifier
    value is used to find an existing page on the configured Confluence
    instance. When found, the root document of the documentation set being
    published will replace the content of the page found on the Confluence
    instance. If the root page cannot be found, the publish attempt will stop
    with an error message.

    .. code-block:: python

       confluence_publish_root = 123456

    See also :lref:`confluence_parent_page`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.5

.. _confluence_root_homepage:

.. confval:: confluence_root_homepage

    A boolean value to whether or not force the configured space's homepage to
    be set to the page defined by the Sphinx configuration's root_doc_. By
    default, the root_doc_ configuration is ignored with a value of ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_root_homepage = False

    .. versionadded:: 1.6

.. _confluence_timeout:

.. confval:: confluence_timeout

    Force a timeout (in seconds) for network interaction. The timeout used by
    this extension is not explicitly configured (i.e. managed by Requests_). By
    default, assume that any network interaction will not timeout. Since the
    target Confluence instance is most likely to be found on an external server,
    is it recommended to explicitly configure a timeout value based on the
    environment being used. For example, to configure a timeout of ten seconds,
    the following can be used:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_timeout = 10

.. _confluence_watch:

.. confval:: confluence_watch

    Indicate whether or not the user publishing content will automatically watch
    pages for changes. In Confluence, when creating a new page or updating an
    existing page, the editing user will automatically watch the page.
    Notifications on automatically published content is typically not relevant
    to publishers through this extension, especially if the content is volatile.
    If a publisher wishes to be keep informed on notification for published
    pages, this option can be set to ``True``. By default, watching is disabled
    with a value of ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_watch = False

    See also :lref:`confluence_disable_notifications`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3

Advanced publishing configuration
---------------------------------

.. confval:: confluence_additional_mime_types

    Candidate selection for images will only support the internally managed list
    of MIME types supported by a default Confluence instance. A custom
    installation or future installations of a Confluence instance may support
    newer MIME types not explicitly managed by this extension. This
    configuration provides a user the option to register additional MIME types
    to consider for image candidates.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_additional_mime_types = [
            'image/tiff',
        ]

    .. versionadded:: 1.3

.. confval:: confluence_asset_force_standalone

    Provides an override to always publish individual assets (images, downloads,
    etc.) on each individual document which uses them. This extension will
    attempt to minimize the amount of publishing of shared assets on multiple
    documents by only hosting an asset in a single document. For example, if two
    documents use the same image, the image will be hosted on the root document
    of a set and each document will reference the attachment on the root page. A
    user may wish to override this feature. By configuring this option to
    ``True``, this extension will publish asset files as an attachment for each
    document which may use the asset. By default, this extension will attempt to
    host shared assets on a single document with a value of ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_asset_force_standalone = True

    .. versionadded:: 1.3

.. _confluence_asset_override:

.. confval:: confluence_asset_override

    Provides an override for asset publishing to allow a user publishing to
    either force re-publishing assets or disable asset publishing. This
    extension will attempt to publish assets (images, downloads, etc.) to pages
    via Confluence's attachment feature. Attachments are assigned a comment
    value with a hash value of a published asset. If another publishing event
    occurs, the hash value is checked before attempting to re-publish an asset.
    In unique scenarios, are use may wish to override this ability. By
    configuring this option to ``True``, this extension will always publish
    asset files (whether or not an attachment with a matching hash exists). By
    configuring this option to ``False``, no assets will be published by this
    extension. By default, this automatic asset publishing occurs with a value
    of ``None``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_asset_override = None

.. _confluence_ca_cert:

.. confval:: confluence_ca_cert

    Provide a CA certificate to use for server certificate authentication. The
    value for this option can either be a file of a certificate or a path
    pointing to an OpenSSL-prepared directory. Refer to the
    `Requests SSL Cert Verification`_  documentation (``verify``) for more
    information. If server verification is explicitly disabled, this option is
    ignored. By default, this option is ignored with a value of ``None``.

         | Page children is currently only supported for direct children.

    Configures the search mode used for finding descendant pages to be cleaned
    up (when configured for archiving/purging legacy pages). By default, this
    extension will search Confluence for known descendants for the root page:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_cleanup_search_mode = 'search'

    However, in some cases, the provided list of descendants may be incorrect
    (due to the Confluence version used, the state of Confluence's ancestors
    table caching, etc.). This configuration can be used to tweak how this
    extension searches for descendants, if a user experiences issues with the
    default method of searching. Supported modes are as follows:

    - ``direct``: Query known descendants from a page's cache.
    - ``search`` `(default)`: Search for descendants using Confluence's CQL
      capability.

    Users can also postfix ``-aggressive`` (e.g. ``search-aggressive``) on a
    mode to perform a recursive search for descendants ensure all descendants
    are found. Note that an aggressive search will increase the amount of API
    calls to a configured Confluence instance.

    Provide a client certificate to use for two-way TLS/SSL authentication. The
    value for this option can either be a file (containing a certificate and
    private key) or as a tuple where both certificate and private keys are
    explicitly provided. If a private key is protected with a passphrase, a user
    publishing a documentation set will be prompted for a password (see also

    A boolean value to explicitly disable the automatic generation of titles for
    documents which do not have a title set. When this extension processes a set
    of documents to publish, a document needs a title value to know which
    Confluence page to create/update. In the event where a title value cannot be
    extracted from a document, a title value will be automatically generated for
    the document. For automatically generated titles, the value will always be
    prefixed with ``autogen-``. For users who wish to ignore pages which have no

    documents, a user may not want to have any title modifications on the index
    page. To prevent modifying an index page's title, this option can be set to
    ``True``. By default, this option is set to ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_ignore_titlefix_on_index = True

.. confval:: confluence_page_search_mode

    .. note::

        This option is only supported using the ``v1``
        :ref:`editor <confluence_editor>`.

    Configures the mode which pages will be fetched from Confluence. For
    Confluence Data Center instances, there may be performance issues when
    attempting to query ``content/`` API (CONFSERVER-57639_). Select environments
    may opt to disable this endpoint in attempt to avoid performance issues,
    which in turn prevents this extension from fetching page content. To
    support these environments, users can configure this extension to use an
    alternative mode for fetching page content.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_page_search_mode = 'search'

    Supported modes are as follows:

    - ``content`` `(default)`: Pages will fetched using the ``content/`` API.
    - ``search``: Pages will fetched using the ``content/search/`` API.

    .. versionadded:: 2.6

.. confval:: confluence_parent_override_transform

    .. note::

        Using this option may have unexpected results when using certain
        features of this extension. For example, users with purging
        enabled may not have pages with parent-ID overrides purged.

    A function to override the parent page to publish a document under.
    This option is available for advanced users needing to tailor specific
    parent pages for individual documents. A provided transform is invoked
    with the document name and the expected parent page (numerical
    identifier) the document will be published under. A configuration can
    tweak the identifier used when publishing.

    .. code-block:: python

        def my_publish_override(docname, parent_id):
            if docname == 'special-doc':
                return 123456

            return parent_id

        confluence_parent_override_transform = my_publish_override

    This extension will not check the validity of the identifiers set. If
    a provided page identifier does not exist or the publishing user does
    not have access to the parent page, the publication will fail with an
    error provided by Confluence.

    See also :lref:`confluence_parent_page`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.2

.. confval:: confluence_proxy

    REST calls use the Requests_ library, which will use system-defined proxy
    configuration; however, a user can override the system-defined proxy by
    providing a proxy server using this configuration.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_proxy = 'myawesomeproxy:8080'

.. _confluence_publish_allowlist:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_allowlist

    .. note::

        Using this option will disable the :lref:`confluence_cleanup_archive`
        and :lref:`confluence_cleanup_purge` options.

    Defines a list of documents to be published to a Confluence instance. When a
    user invokes sphinx-build_, a user has the ability to process all documents
    (by default) or specifying individual filenames which use the provide files
    and detected dependencies. If the Sphinx-detected set of documents to
    process contains undesired documents to publish,
    ``confluence_publish_allowlist`` can be used to override this. This option
    accepts either a list of relative path document names (without an extension)
    or a filename which contains a list of document names.

    For example, a user can specify documents in a list to allow for publishing:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_allowlist = [
            'index',
            'foo/bar',
        ]

    Alternatively, a user can specify a filename such as following:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_allowlist = 'allowed-docs.txt'

    Which could contain a list of documents to allow:

    .. code-block:: python

        index
        foo/bar

    A user can configured an allowed list of documents through the command line:

    .. code-block:: shell

        sphinx-build [options] -D confluence_publish_allowlist=index,foo/bar \
            <srcdir> <outdir> index.rst foo/bar.rst

    By default, this option is ignored with a value of ``None``.

    See also :lref:`confluence_publish_denylist`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3
    .. versionchanged:: 2.0 An empty allow list will no longer publish any
                            documents.
    .. versionchanged:: 2.3 Support relative paths.

.. _confluence_publish_debug:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_debug

    .. warning::

        Enabling certain debugging options may reveal information such as
        authentication details in printed logs. Take this into consideration
        when sharing any debug logs with other users or enabling this option
        when part of a CI/CD script, job or workflow.

    Configures the ability to enable certain debugging messages for requests
    made to a Confluence instance. This can be helpful for users attempting
    to debug their connection to a Confluence instance. By default, no
    debugging is enabled.

    Available options are as follows:

    - ``all``: Enable all debugging options.
    - ``deprecated``: Log warnings when a deprecated API call is used
      (*for development purposes*).
    - ``headers``: Log requests and responses, including their headers.
    - ``headers-and-data``: Log header data along with request/response bodies.
    - ``urllib3``: Enable urllib3 library debugging messages.

    An example debugging configuration is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_debug = 'headers'

    .. versionadded:: 1.8
    .. versionchanged:: 2.5

        Switched from boolean to string for setting new debugging options.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.6

        Introduce the ``headers-and-data`` option.

.. confval:: confluence_publish_delay

    Force a delay (in seconds) for any API calls made to a Confluence instance.
    By default, API requests will be made to a Confluence instance as soon as
    possible (or until Confluence reports that the client should be rate
    limiting). A user can use this option to reduce how fast this extension may
    attempt to interact with the Confluence instance. For example, to delay each
    API request by almost a 1/4 of a second, the following can be used:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_delay = 0.25

    .. versionadded:: 1.8

.. _confluence_publish_denylist:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_denylist

    .. note::

        Using this option will disable the :lref:`confluence_cleanup_archive`
        and :lref:`confluence_cleanup_purge` options.

    Defines a list of documents to not be published to a Confluence instance.
    When a user invokes sphinx-build_, a user has the ability to process all
    documents (by default) or specifying individual filenames which use the
    provide files and detected dependencies. If the Sphinx-detected set of
    documents to process contain undesired documents to publish,
    ``confluence_publish_denylist`` can be used to override this. This option
    accepts either a list of relative path document names (without an extension)
    or a filename which contains a list of document names.

    For example, a user can specify documents in a list to deny for publishing:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_denylist = [
            'index',
            'foo/bar',
        ]

    Alternatively, a user can specify a filename such as following:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_denylist = 'denied-docs.txt'

    Which could contain a list of documents to allow:

    .. code-block:: python

        index
        foo/bar

    A user can configured a denied list of documents through the command line:

    .. code-block:: shell

        sphinx-build [options] -D confluence_publish_denylist=index,foo/bar \
            <srcdir> <outdir> index.rst foo/bar.rst

    By default, this option is ignored with a value of ``None``.

    See also :lref:`confluence_publish_allowlist`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3
    .. versionchanged:: 2.3 Support relative paths.

.. _confluence_publish_force:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_force

    A boolean value on whether or not to force publish page updates even if
    no changes are detected on the Confluence instance. When a page is
    published by this extension, a hash of the page will be stored on the
    Confluence page. This hash can be referred to later by hosts using this
    extension, by querying the hash and comparing it against a locally prepared
    page update. If hashes match, no attempt will be made to update the
    specific page. If users are experiencing issues with this check, they may
    force publishing by configuring this option to ``True``. By default, this
    option is disabled with a value of ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_force = True

    See also :lref:`confluence_asset_override`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.1

.. _confluence_publish_headers:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_headers

    A dictionary value which allows a user to pass key-value header information.
    This is useful for users who need to interact with a Confluence instance
    which expects (in a reverse proxy or the instance itself) specific header
    information to be set. By default, no custom header entries are added with a
    value of ``None``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_headers = {
            'CUSTOM_HEADER': '<some-value>',
        }

    .. versionadded:: 1.5

.. confval:: confluence_publish_intersphinx

    A publish event will upload a generated intersphinx's inventory
    (`object.inv`) as an attachment to the configured root_doc_. Inventory
    files are typically small and should not cause issues for most users.
    However, if a user desired to not publish an inventory for their
    documentation, this option can be configured to ``False``. By default,
    inventories are published with a value of ``True``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_intersphinx = True

    .. versionadded:: 1.9

.. confval:: confluence_publish_onlynew

    A publish event from this extension will typically upload new pages or
    update existing pages on future attempts. In select cases, a user may not
    wish to modify existing pages and only permit adding new content to a
    Confluence space. To achieve this, a user can enable an "only-new" flag
    which prevents the modification of existing content. This includes the
    restriction of updating existing pages/attachments as well as deleting
    content. By default, the only-new feature is disabled with a value of
    ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_onlynew = True

    .. versionadded:: 1.3

.. _confluence_publish_orphan:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_orphan

    Whether to permit the publishing of orphan pages to a Confluence space.
    This option must be explicitly set to ``False`` if a user wishes to not
    publish orphan pages for their documentation. By default, the value is set
    to ``True``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_orphan = True

    See also :lref:`confluence_publish_orphan_container`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.1

.. _confluence_publish_orphan_container:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_orphan_container

    The identifier of the page to hold orphan pages. The parent page
    associated to an orphan page can vary per configuration. When a user
    configures for a parent page/root, orphan pages will be placed under the
    respective parent page/root configuration. If no parent page/root is
    configured, orphan pages will not be associated with a parent page.

    Users can override where orphan pages are placed by using this option. By
    specifying a page identifier, orphan pages will placed under the configured
    container page. Users can also provide a special value of ``0`` to indicate
    to always publish with no parent page.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_orphan_container = 123456

    See also :lref:`confluence_publish_orphan`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.1

.. _confluence_publish_override_api_prefix:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_override_api_prefix

    Allows a user to override the path-prefix value used for API requests.
    API paths are commonly prefixed, such as ``rest/api/`` for API v1 and
    ``api/v2/`` for API v2. However, if a user is interacting with a Confluence
    instance which system administrators have configured non-standard
    locations for API endpoints, requests made by this extension will fail.

    To support custom API endpoint paths, this option can be used to indicate
    what prefix to use, if any. By default, this extension operates with an
    API prefix configuration matching the following:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_override_api_prefix = {
            'v1': 'rest/api/',
            'v2': 'api/v2/',
        }

    Users may define a dictionary using :lref:`confluence_api_mode` values for
    keys, followed by a prefix override for their environment. For example,
    to disable prefixes for any API v1 request, the following may be used:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_override_api_prefix = {
            'v1': '',
        }

    .. versionadded:: 2.5

.. _confluence_publish_retry_attempts:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_retry_attempts

    Allows a user to override how many retry attempts are permitted when a
    single API request fails. By default, this extension uses a maximum
    retry of two, allowing a single request to be attempted three times
    for select failure events.

    Failure scenarios that are retried on include all 500-series errors,
    as well as couple of observed/reported corner cases reported by
    Confluence instances during the life-cycle of this extension.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_retry_attempts = 2

    See also :lref:`confluence_publish_retry_duration`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.10

.. _confluence_publish_retry_duration:

.. confval:: confluence_publish_retry_duration

    The duration (in seconds) to wait between API retry events on select
    failures. By default, the duration waited is four seconds.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_retry_duration = 4

    See also :lref:`confluence_publish_retry_attempts`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.10

.. confval:: confluence_publish_skip_commented_pages

    .. note::

        There is no support to keep inlined comments on updated pages at
        this time.

    Indicates to skip updates on pages which have inlined comments. Before
    a page update is issued, a warning will be generated if this extension
    detects that a page has inlined comments added to it. Page updates
    remove any inlined comments embedded in the page source. If a users
    wants to prevent any updates on pages to prevent the loss of inlined
    comments, they can configure this option to ``True``. By default, pages
    will always be updated with a value of ``False``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_publish_skip_commented_pages = True

    See also :lref:`suppress_warnings_config`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.13

.. confval:: confluence_request_session_override

    A hook to manipulate a Requests_ session prepared by this extension. Allows
    users who wish to perform advanced configuration of a session for features
    which may not be supported by this extension.

    .. code-block:: python

        def my_request_session_override(session):
            session.trust_env = False

        confluence_request_session_override = my_request_session_override

    .. versionadded:: 1.7

.. _confluence_server_auth:

.. confval:: confluence_server_auth

    An authentication handler which can be directly provided to a REST API
    request. REST calls in this extension use the Requests_ library, which
    provide various methods for a client to perform authentication. While this
    extension provides simple authentication support (via
    :lref:`confluence_server_user` and :lref:`confluence_server_pass`),
    a publisher may need to configure an advanced authentication handler
    to support a target Confluence instance.

    Note that this extension does not define custom authentication handlers.
    This configuration is a passthrough option only. For more details on various
    ways to use authentication handlers, please see
    `Requests -- Authentication`_. By default, no custom authentication handler
    is provided to generated REST API requests. An example OAuth 1 is as
    follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1

        ...

        confluence_server_auth = OAuth1(client_key,
            client_secret=client_secret,
            resource_owner_key=resource_owner_key,
            resource_owner_secret=resource_owner_secret)

.. _confluence_server_cookies:

.. confval:: confluence_server_cookies

    A dictionary value which allows a user to pass key-value cookie information
    for authentication purposes. This is useful for users who need to
    authenticate with a single sign-on (SSO) provider to access a target
    Confluence instance. By default, no cookies are set with a value of
    ``None``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_server_cookies = {
            'SESSION_ID': '<session id string>',
            'U_ID': '<username>',
        }

    .. versionadded:: 1.2

.. _confluence_title_overrides:

.. confval:: confluence_title_overrides

    Allows a user to override the title value for a specific document. When
    documents are parsed for title values, the first title element's content
    will be used as the publish page's title. Select documents may not include a
    title and are ignored; or, documents may conflict with each other but there
    is a desire to keep them the same name in reStructuredText form. With
    ``confluence_title_overrides``, a user can define a dictionary which will
    map a given docname to a title value instead of the title element (if any)
    found in the respective document. By default, documents will give assigned
    titles values based off the first detected title element with a value of
    ``None``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_title_overrides = {
            'index': 'Index Override',
        }

.. confval:: confluence_version_comment

    .. note::

        Confluence Data Center does not support setting a version comment for
        the first/new page revision.

    A string value to be added as a comment to Confluence's version history.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_version_comment = 'Automatically generated.'

    .. versionadded:: 1.8
    .. versionchanged:: 2.1

        Support comments for first/new pages on Confluence Cloud.

Advanced processing configuration
---------------------------------

.. _confluence_file_suffix:

.. confval:: confluence_file_suffix

    The file name suffix to use for all generated files. By default, all
    generated files will use the extension ``.conf``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_file_suffix = '.conf'

.. _confluence_html_macro:

.. confval:: confluence_html_macro

    This option will configure the HTML macro type for the ``confluence_html``
    :ref:`directive <confluence_html>`. By default, the ``html`` macro
    identifier is set.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_html_macro = 'html'

    See also the :ref:`HTML directive <confluence_html>`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.7

.. index:: Jira; Configuring Jira servers

.. _confluence_jira_servers:

.. confval:: confluence_jira_servers

    Provides a dictionary of named Jira servers to reference when using the
    ``jira`` or ``jira_issue`` directives. In a typical Confluence environment
    which is linked with a Jira instance, users do not need to take advantage of
    this configuration -- Confluence should automatically be able to link to
    respectively Jira issues or map Jira query languages with a configured Jira
    instance. In select cases where an instance has more than one Jira instance
    attached, a user may need to explicitly reference a Jira instance to
    properly render a Jira macro. Jira-related directives have the ability to
    reference Jira instances, with a combination of a UUID and name; for
    example:

    .. code-block:: rst

        .. jira_issue:: TEST-151
            :server-id: d005bcc2-ca4e-4065-8ce8-49ff5ac5857d
            :server-name: MyAwesomeJiraServer

    It may be tedious for some projects to add this information in each
    document. As an alternative, a configuration can define Jira instance
    information inside a configuration option as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_jira_servers = {
            'server-1': {
                'id': '<UUID of Jira Instance>',
                'name': '<Name of Jira Instance>',
            }
        }

    With the above option defined in a project's configuration, the following
    can be used instance inside a document:

    .. code-block:: rst

        .. jira_issue:: TEST-151
            :server: server-1

    - :ref:`Jira directives <jira-directives>`
    - :ref:`Jira roles <jira-roles>`

    .. versionadded:: 1.2

.. _confluence_lang_overrides:

.. confval:: confluence_lang_overrides

    A dictionary to override literal block-based directive language values to
    a Confluence supported code block macro language values. The default
    mapping accepts `Pygments documented language types`_ to
    `Confluence-supported syntax highlight languages`_.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_lang_overrides = {
            'rs': 'rust',
            'rust': 'rust',
        }

    In the event that a language entry is missing or returns a ``None`` value,
    the provided language type will be transform to a default language type
    as if this transform was not provided.

    .. versionadded:: 2.6

.. _confluence_latex_macro:

.. confval:: confluence_latex_macro

    .. note::

        Confluence does not provide stock support for LaTeX macros.

    The name of a LaTeX macro to use when wishing to render LaTeX content on
    a Confluence instance. Stock Confluence instances do not support LaTeX
    content by default. However, if an instance has installed a marketplace
    add-on that supports LaTeX, this option can be used to hint to render LaTeX
    content (such as mathematical notation) by configuring this option.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_latex_macro = 'macro-name'
         (or)
        confluence_latex_macro = {
            'block-macro': 'block-macro-name',
            'inline-macro': 'inline-macro-name',
            'inline-macro-param': 'inline-macro-parameter', # (optional)
        }

    The name of a LaTeX macro will vary based on which add-on is installed.
    For a list of known macro names or steps to determine the name of a
    supported macro, see the
    :ref:`macro table/instructions <guide_math_macro_names>`
    found in the math guide.

    If this option is not set, any LaTeX content processed in a document will
    instead be converted to images using dvipng/dvisvgm (see also
    `sphinx.ext.imgmath`_ for additional information).

    .. versionadded:: 1.8

.. _confluence_link_suffix:

.. confval:: confluence_link_suffix

    The suffix name to use for generated links to files. By default, all
    generated links will use the value defined by
    :lref:`confluence_file_suffix`.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_link_suffix = '.conf'

.. _confluence_mathjax:

.. confval:: confluence_mathjax

    .. important::

        This option relies on additional configuration of a Confluence
        instance or additional directives such as using an HTML macro.
        Both of these approaches may not be available in a default
        Confluence configuration. Confluence Cloud may require a custom
        marketplace add-on. Confluence Data Center can require a system
        administrator configuring site support for MathJax; or environments
        that have a Confluence HTML macro enabled, users can attempt to
        include MathJax library support via the use of a
        :lref:`confluence_html` directive.

        While this extension aims to support the capability of generating

        using MathJax on a Confluence instance is considered unsupported.

.. confval:: confluence_manifest_data

    A manifest file (``scb-manifest.json``) is generated after each run
    into the output directory. This information includes built pages as
    well as attachments for these pages. Each page/attachment provides a
    path to where the content resides. However, if a user wishes to
    include this data into the manifest, this option can be used to
    Base64-encode page/attachment data into the manifest. By default, this
    is disabled:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_manifest_data = True

    .. versionadded:: 2.10

.. index:: Mentions; Configuration

.. _confluence_mentions:

.. confval:: confluence_mentions

    Provides a dictionary of key-to-value mappings which can be used with
    ``confluence_mention`` roles. When defining mentions, documents can
    reference a user's account identifier, user key or username (depending
    on the Confluence instance being published to). This configuration can
    be used to swap the value mentioned in a document with a value specified
    in configuration. For example, with the following configuration:

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_mentions = {
            'myuser':  '3c5369:fa8b5c24-17f8-4340-b73e-50d383307c59',
        }

    With a document such as follows:

    .. code-block:: rst

        For more information, contact :confluence_mention:`myuser`.

    The value ``myuser`` will be replaced with the configured account
    identifier. This can be useful for when trying to manage multiple
    user's account identifiers when targeting a Confluence Cloud instance,
    as well as providing a quick-way to swap a generic contact role which
    may change over time.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9

.. confval:: confluence_navdocs_transform

    A function to override the document list used for populating navigational
    buttons generated from a :lref:`confluence_prev_next_buttons_location`
    configuration. This can be helpful in advanced publishing cases where a user
    would like ignore or re-order select pages from navigation, or even
    reference pages outside of documentation list.

    .. code-block:: python

        def my_navdocs_transform(builder, docnames):
            # override and return a new docnames list
            return docnames

       confluence_navdocs_transform = my_navdocs_transform

    See also :lref:`confluence_prev_next_buttons_location`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.7

.. _confluence_permit_raw_html:

.. confval:: confluence_permit_raw_html

    .. caution::

        Using this option is considered unsupported. This extension will
        allow users to directly publish HTML content defined in a document,
        but there is no guarantees that the content will render as expected,
        or even be able to be published to a configured Confluence instance.

    Configure whether to permit the use of raw HTML content in generated
    documents. While Confluence renders pages through a website, content
    is stored using a "storage" format, which only supports a subset of HTML.
    Confluence may filter out or reject the publication of pages with certain
    HTML content.

    Some documentation may rely on HTML-specific content, and if this HTML
    content is not too complex, this may be renderable on a Confluence
    instance. Users wanting to allow this can enable this option to have
    HTML content directly injected on pages, or even placed inside an
    HTML-supported macro (if such a macro is available for the target
    Confluence instance):

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_permit_raw_html = True
         (or)
        confluence_permit_raw_html = 'html'

    Using this option is not supported. Content may be automatically
    stripped when published into Confluence, content may not render as
    expected (e.g. styles can be ignored, JavaScript will not function)
    or Confluence may reject the publication of Confluence document (i.e.
    failing to upload a page).

    See also :lref:`confluence_html` directive.

    .. versionadded:: 2.2

.. _confluence_tab_macro:

.. confval:: confluence_tab_macro

    .. attention::

        This feature is considered experimental. Inlined tabs are supported
        through third-party Sphinx extensions as well as only supported on
        Confluence instances using third-party marketplace extensions. The
        combination is less than ideal for providing consistent results and
        performing testing. This may be used by advanced users who can take
        advantage of their instance's configurations to utilize inlined tabs.

    This configuration is used when attempting to build macros for rendering
    inlined tabs on a page. It is used to define what third-party macro can
    be used to render inlined tabs. This configuration also defines what
    parameter values dictate the name of a tab and well as which tab is
    considered to be the first/primary tab for a set.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_tab_macro = {
            'macro-name': 'macro-name',
            'primary-id': 'id-for-primary-parameter',
            'primary-value': 'value-to-primary-parameter',
            'title-id': 'id-for-title-parameter',
        }

    The following configurations are known to function for the listed
    marketplace extensions:

    .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 40 60

        * - Marketplace Application

          - Configuration

        * - Mosaic: Content Formatting Macros & Templates for Confluence

                confluence_tab_macro = {
                    'macro-name': 'cfm-tabs-page',
                    'primary-id': 'primaryTab',
                    'primary-value': 'true',
                    'title-id': 'tabsPageTitle',
                }

    .. versionadded:: 2.14

.. _confluence_remove_title:

.. confval:: confluence_remove_title

    A boolean value to whether or not automatically remove the title section
    from all published pages. In Confluence, page names are already presented at
    the top. With this option enabled, this reduces having two leading headers
    with the document's title. In some cases, a user may wish to not remove
    titles when custom prefixes or other custom modifications are in play. By
    default, this option is enabled with a value of ``True``.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_remove_title = True

    See also:

    - :lref:`confluence_disable_autogen_title`
    - :lref:`confluence_title_overrides`

Third-party related options
---------------------------

.. note::

    The configurations in this section are specific to supporting
    :ref:`third-party extensions <extensions_third_party>`; results may
    vary.

.. confval:: confluence_mermaid_html_macro

    .. warning::

        This option relies on an HTML macro which is not available in a
        default Confluence configuration. Using this option is only useful
        for users that have instances where a system administrator has
        enabled their use.

    .. note::

        This option will most likely require additional configuration to
        function. Setting this option only produces HTML macros with Mermaid
        content but does not automatically include the JavaScript required to
        process this content.

        There can be various ways an instance/page can be configured to
        include Mermaid JS support. For example, adding the following content
        on the page planning to render diagrams:

        .. raw:: latex

            {\footnotesize

        .. code-block:: rst

            .. confluence_html::

                <script type="module">
                import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs';
                </script>

        .. raw:: latex

            }

    When using the `sphinxcontrib-mermaid`_ extension, this option can be
    used pass raw Mermaid figures into an HTML macro.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_mermaid_html_macro = True

    See also :lref:`confluence_html_macro`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.7

Other options
-------------

.. _suppress_warnings_config:

.. confval:: suppress_warnings

    This extension supports suppressing warnings using Sphinx's
    `suppress_warnings`_ configuration. The following includes additional
    warning types that may be suppressed:

    - ``confluence`` -- All warnings
    - ``confluence.deprecated`` -- Configuration deprecated warnings
    - ``confluence.deprecated_develop`` -- Development deprecated warnings
    - ``confluence.inline-comment`` -- Inlined comment warnings
    - ``confluence.unsupported_code_lang`` -- Unsupported code language

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        suppress_warnings = [
            'confluence.unsupported_code_lang',
        ]

    .. versionadded:: 2.1

Deprecated options
------------------

.. confval:: confluence_lang_transform

    This option has been replaced by :lref:`confluence_lang_overrides`.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.6

.. confval:: confluence_master_homepage

    This option has been renamed to :lref:`confluence_root_homepage`.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.6

.. confval:: confluence_parent_page_id_check

        The :lref:`confluence_parent_page` option now accepts both a page
        name and identifier.

    The page identifier check for :lref:`confluence_parent_page`. By
    providing an identifier of the parent page, both the parent page's
    name and identifier must match before this extension will publish
    any content to a Confluence instance. This serves as a sanity-check
    configuration for the cautious.

    .. code-block:: python

        confluence_parent_page_id_check = 123456

    See also :lref:`confluence_parent_page`.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.9
